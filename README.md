## Installation
Simply download the .btt preset and open with BetterTouchTool. Customize as you like, and have fun! I adapted everything here from other presets (especially Minimalist and GoldenChaos - thanks to the developers!) and you can likewise use this as a template to build the perfect minimalist layout for your own workflow.

## Background / Touchbar philosophy
The touchbar is neat from a tech perspective, but is pretty useless in the standard macOS configuration. Luckily BetterTouchTool opens up the entirety of this little OLED display to program it as you wish!
Personally I didn't have any issue with the function keys on older Macbook Pros. The volume, play/pause, previous/next song and brightness controls I use often were right there at all times. Since getting a new MBP with Touchbar, I've tried a bunch of different configurations and have found some useful presets for Ableton and Sibelius, as well as the useful functionality already built in for Logic. However, I can't say that having a touchbar has revolutionized my workflow in any significant way.
Most of the time I'm just looking for something with the same functionality that was there before, and don't need or want the touchbar to change with every single application I open. I'm not looking for a dock in my touchbar or a dense layout with every function imaginable. GoldenChaos has some great functionality but it's just too much to have open all the time. A simple, minimalist layout helps me stay relaxed and inspired. So I adapted elements from other presets and customzied some of my own elements to build this touchbar preset.
The core functionality is pretty much just the same as what was there before the touchbar, with the addition of the now playing display and weather view which I find to be helpful. Everything else (battery status, date & time, Spotlight, Siri, etc. is already at the top right of my display so I have no need for it in the touchbar. When no music player is running the middle of the touchbar is just black space. Ah, the sweet glow of a clutter-free OLED true black that nourishes the soul and leaves room for new creativity to blossom from the darkness.
